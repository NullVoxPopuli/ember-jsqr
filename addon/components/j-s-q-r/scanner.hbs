  It doesn't make sense to render anything at all if
  we don't even have a camera stream.

  NOTE:
    Since everyone would be wrapping JSQR::Scanner
    in an if statement, it's kinda just a convenience
    to have it here.

{{#if @cameraStream}}
  {{!--
    The canvas here should have zero size so the loader below
    should be unimpeeded.

    Once the animation frame handler begins, the
    height and width will be overwritten with the
    dimensions of the camera.
    See: attach-qr-scanner#tick
  --}}
  <canvas
    height='0'
    width='0'
    {{attach-video @cameraStream this.onPlay}}
    {{attach-qr-scanner
      this.video
      onData=@onData
      onReady=this.onReady
      highlightColor=@highlightColor
    }}
    ...attributes

  </canvas>

  {{!--
    We definitely do not want to force a loader on users.
